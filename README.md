# Monetary Policy Evaluation - A Bachelor Thesis

Here you can find supporting documentation for the Bachelor Thesis *"Monetary Policy Evaluation with Data Irregularities: A Factor Augmented Vector Autoregression Analysis"*.

The files are divided into three classes:
<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
  <li>Files beginning with "A" are `.Rdata` files that contain the raw data or data for the graphs</li>
  <li>Files beginning with "CODE" are `.R` files that contain replicable R-code</li>
  <li>Files beginning with "GRAPHS" are `.Rmd` files that can be executed to get the graphs from the thesis</li>
 </ul>

To replicate the graphs from my paper, you have two options:
<ol>
  <li>Directly run the "GRAPHS" files to get the graphs based on the data stored in the "A" files</li>
  <li>Run (and feel free to inspect/change) the "CODE"-files to see how the graphs are constructed and subsequently run the "GRAPHS" files if you wish so</li>
</ol>

Feel free to open an issue or send me an [email](mailto:truesch@mail.uni-mannheim.de) when you have questions or find errors in my analysis.
